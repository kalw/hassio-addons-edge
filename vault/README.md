## WARNING! THIS IS AN EDGE VERSION!

This Home Assistant Add-ons repository contains edge builds of add-ons.
Edge builds add-ons are based upon the latest development version.

- They may not work at all.
- They might stop working at any time.
- They could have a negative impact on your system.

This repository was created for:

- Anybody willing to test.
- Anybody interested in trying out upcoming add-ons or add-on features.
- Developers.

If you are more interested in stable releases of our add-ons:

### Summary

- Launch an Hashicorp vault server in raft mode. 
- The default ssl key from /ssl is used if it exists.
- TLS can be disabled by setting "disable_tls" to true :
```bash
disable_tls: true
```


### Install

Use the following repository (add it in the add-on store of the supervisor) :
https://github.com/kalw/hassio-addons


### Custom the configuration
- You can use the vault_local_config variable (see https://hub.docker.com/_/vault)
- The raft data is stored in /data/vault/raft, it'll be removed if you remove the addon. 
- You can change that by using the raft_path setting (it'll probably break the other scripts)
```bash
raft_path: /config/vault/raft
```


### Unsafe auto unseal
- You can enable unsafe auto unseal (it'll store the unseal keys and root token in clear in /data/vault/vault.ini)
```bash
unsafe_auto_init: true
```

### Auto provisioning
- You can enable initial config of the vault: It'll run a terraform config (it can be in changed in /config/vault/terraform)
```bash
auto_provision: true
```
- If you don't use unsafe auto unseal (it stores a token), you can specify a provisioning token (make it short lived)
````
provision_token_password: a_token
````

- You can create a default user with an admin policy attached like that: 
```bash
create_admin_user: true
vault_admin_user: admin
vault_admin_password: some_password
```

### Use keybase to encrypt initial keys
- You can enable auto initialization with gpg/keybase keys:
```bash
pgp_keys: 'keybase:exampleuser'
```
- the encrypted variables are shown in the log (fixme?)
- if you use keybase and no kms autounseal you'll need to unseal manually
```bash
export VAULT_ADDR="http(s)://yourinstance:8200"
vault operator unseal [-migrate] $(echo $unsealkey | base64 -d | keybase pgp decrypt)
```

### Use AWS KMS for autounseal
It's possible to use the AWS KMS service to auto unseal the vault. 
You'll need to create the kms key and the iam user credentials with correct policy (kms:Encrypt,kms:Decrypt and kms:DescribeKey).

Then you can set the following values:
```bash
aws_unseal: true
aws_region: eu-west-1
aws_access_key: *****
aws_secret_key: ******
aws_kms_key_id: ******
```

If you disable aws kms, you need to set the downgrade variable (at least for the transition) (fixme)
```bash
aws_unseal: false
aws_unseal_downgrade: true
```

### Enable the cluster
Cluster listener addr is set to localhost by default. 

Set it to a valid address through 'vault_cluster_addr' then enable the port forward for tcp/8201 (provide a value for the port)
(it's untested, no automated setup for multi nodes for now)

### Downgrading from keybase to unsafe local storage
It's a bit tricky and those commands need to be exec outside of the addon container: 

- Retrieve the needed values from the logs (keys_b64, encoded_root_token and adm.asc)
- Config your local vault client to reach your vault server addon (export VAULT_ADDR=..)
- Unseal the vault using your keybase
- Create a provisioning token
- Set it in the config, restart
- Start the rekeing using a backup
- The script will retrieve the backup using the provisioning token above.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# $1 is the encrypted unseal key (keys_b64 from the logs)
# $2 is the encrypted root key (encoded_root_token from the logs)
# $3 is the gpg key of the local unsafe storage (adm.asc from the logs)

decrypt () {
  echo $1 | base64 -d | keybase pgp decrypt
}

vault operator unseal $(decrypt $1)

vault login $(decrypt $2)
vault token create -ttl=2h

echo "copy this token in the setting \"provision_token_password:\""
echo "and set unsafe_downgrade: true"
echo "then restart the addon, press enter when done"

read a

echo "$3" | base64 -d >> pb2
vault operator unseal $(decrypt $1)

echo "Sleep for elections"
sleep 15 

nonce=$(vault operator rekey -format json -pgp-keys=pb2 -key-shares=1 -key-threshold=1 -init -backup | jq -r .nonce)
vault operator rekey -nonce $nonce $(decrypt $1)
```
