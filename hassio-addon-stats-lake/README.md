Long-term storage for Home Assistant sensor data via DuckLake on S3-compatible storage.

## About

Samples a configured list of entities every 30 minutes to flat per-entity
monthly CSV files, then nightly:

- consolidates new rows into a [DuckLake](https://ducklake.select/) (Parquet)
  on any **S3-compatible store** (Cloudflare R2, AWS S3, MinIO, …)
- syncs raw CSVs to any [rclone](https://rclone.org/) remote as a cold backup
  (OneDrive, Google Drive, SFTP, …)

Pick which entities to track from a built-in **entity picker** (a web UI
opened from the add-on or its sidebar panel) — no hand-editing YAML — or from
the add-on Configuration tab.

Visualization on demand via `duckdb -ui` pointed at your S3 store — no
dashboard server to maintain.
